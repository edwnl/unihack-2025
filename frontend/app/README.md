# Shuffl - Accessible Card Games Platform

Card games should be for everyone‚Äîno matter where you are, what your skill level is, or what challenges you face. üÉè‚ú® That's why we created *Shuffl*.

Shuffl precisely tracks gameplay, powered by speech recognition models, RFID modules, and an Arduino system, while an AI-powered personal coach helps players master the rules and refine their strategy. We're kicking things off with our flagship game poker, but our vision? A world where any card game can be played without limits.
